LORG - Logfile Outlier Recognition and Gathering

A tool for advanced HTTPD logfile security analysis. pre-alpha.
Previously developed as http://sourceforge.net/projects/webforensik/

Bug of the day: there needs to be a symlinl IDS -> . in the phpids/ folder.
(Meaning PHPIDS detection will not work if you just downloaded the zip file)
