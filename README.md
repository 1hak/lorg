LORG - Logfile Outlier Recognition and Gathering
(see also: From Old Irish lorg [ˈl̪ˠɔɾˠə]: trace,track, trail, path, cours, ...)


A tool for advanced HTTPD logfile security analysis. Pre-alpha.
Previously developed as http://sourceforge.net/projects/webforensik/

Bug of the day: there needs to be a symlink IDS -> . in the phpids/ folder.
(Meaning PHPIDS detection might not work if you just downloaded the zip file)

2nd Bug of the day: the include/ folder (contains JS, CSS) must be in the
same folder as our report-*.html file. (TODO: integrate includes in lorg)


Pre-alpha experimental!
Will not work on Windows!
