{"name":"Lorg","tagline":"HTTPD logfile security analysis","body":"## LORG - A tool for advanced HTTPD logfile security analysis. Pre-alpha.\r\n**Previously developed as http://sourceforge.net/projects/webforensik/**\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n**Q:** _What does LORG stand for?_  \r\n**A:** Emm... 'Logfile Outlier Recognition and Gathering'. Also it's an old Irish word ([ˈl̪ˠɔɾˠə]) for trace, track, trail.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _Why would anyone call a programm LORG?_  \r\n**A:** All the other cool names had already been taken.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _What is LORG all about?_  \r\n**A:** It's a PHP-CLI programm that implements various detection techniques to automatically scan your HTTPD logfiles for attacks against web applications.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _A CLI programm? Why in hell PHP?_  \r\n**A:** At the beginning it seemes a good idea to easily integrate PHPIDS.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _ What logfile formats are supported?_  \r\n**A:** Out of the box, common, combined (Apache, nginx) and some more are supported. Other mod_log_config[1]-compatible formats can be easily defined by editing `$allowed_input_types` in the code.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _What about W3C-extended/IIS log file formats?_  \r\n**A:** Convert, using e.g. http://rebex.net/rconvlog/\r\n\r\n**Q:** _I have many seperate logfiles to scan!_  \r\n**A:** Merge, using e.g. http://code.google.com/p/logmerge. If you have several access.log.n.gz files, try e.g. `gunzip access.log.*.gz && cat access.* > merged.log`.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _I want to exclude certain noisy clients (e.g. security scanners) from detection. How to do that?_  \r\n**A:** Pre-process to logfile using grep/sed/awk.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _How to anonymize logs?_  \r\n**A:** Pre-process to logfile using grep/sed/awk (on Remote-User, Remote-Logname, IP address, ...).\r\n\r\n**Q:** _Why does the urldecode switch (-u) have no effect on detection results?_  \r\n**A:** The `-u` switch only affects visualization in the output file. For detection, all HTTP requests are automatically url-decoded before processing.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _Is it possible to output *all* incidents (including harmless ones)?_  \r\n**A:** Yes. Use `-t 0`.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _How fast is LORG?_  \r\n**A:** LORG's performance is primarily dependend on the selected detect mode (`-d`). While mode 'chars' is pretty fast, 'mcshmm' might take more time (while beeing more accurate). Other performance killers are the use of additional attack vectors (`-a`) and DNS/DNSBL (`-h`, `-b`) lookups.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _How to speed it up?_  \r\n**A:** Try setting `$only_check_webapps = true` in the code.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _How much memory does LORG require?_  \r\n**A:** Depending on which detection modes are selected, LORG requires up to the size of the processed logfile.\r\n\r\n**Q:** _How to decrease memory usage?_  \r\n**A:** Disable summarization (`-n`).\r\n\r\n**Q:** _Will it work on Windows?_  \r\n**A:** No.\r\n\r\n--\r\n[1] http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_log_config.html\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Known Issues\r\n\r\n* To make the PHPIDS detection module work, there needs to be a symlink `IDS -> .` in the phpids/ folder\r\n* Geotargeting is incompatible with an Debian/Ubuntu package 'php5-geoip' installation and then switched off automatically\r\n* When showing the results within an SIMILE Exhibit map, your web browser might hang if more than several thousand results are to be displayed\r\n* And many more...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
