## HOW TO VISUALIZE DETECTION RESULTS WITH SIMILE-WIDGETS


For an experimental *map view* of the results:

* use JSON output mode (`-o json`)
* if summerization enabled (default)
** move output file to `./exhibit/summary/results.json`
** open `./exhibit/summary/results.hmtl` in your web browser
* if summerization disabled (`-n`)
** move output file to `./exhibit/details/results.json`
** open `./exhibit/details/results.hmtl` in your web browser


For an experimental *timline view* of the results:

* use XML output mode (`-o xml`)
* move output file to `./timeline/results.xml`
* open `./timeline/results.hmtl` in your web browser https://github.com/jensvoid/lorg/blob/master/simile/README.TXT
